# kifs

The data for the ?kif command in KCD Discord: https://kcd.im/discord

We separate `aliases` and `emojiAliases`. The reason for this is because when we don't have a kif for the given argument we want to suggest something, but our suggestion function doesn't work well for emoji (it gives really random/useless suggestions).
